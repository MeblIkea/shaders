Collection of shaders I made (mainly for OBS), for either [OBS-ShaderFilter](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/obs-shaderfilter.1736/) (files in .shader or .hlsl), [ShaderFilter Plus](https://github.com/Limeth/obs-shaderfilter-plus/?tab=readme-ov-file) (files in .glsl), or [CablesGL](https://cables.gl/) (in .cables).

I'm just dumping this out there, as I think that some of these have some cool ideas.<br>
Some were made with a concrete idea in mind, and other I was just messing around.

*The datamoshing shaders were made in a really cool way, yet it's not perfect (nor actual datamoshing (as it would require to mess with buffers, and I can't do that))*
